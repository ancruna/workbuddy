# mutation flow

Every remote mutation first resolves the actual write target's space type. The user's original explicit request directly authorizes mutations to the user's personal space (我的资料, `category=personal`) when the target and scope are already clear. Only when an actual target is a team space (`category=team`) does the agent present the final plan and pause for explicit user confirmation.

## Target classification

- Existing node: `space.workspace.node-info` for the actual `spaceId`, matched exactly against the same `spaceId` from `space.workspace.list-user-spaces`; the matched `category` is authoritative.
- User-explicit space / directory: use that space's `spaceId` and `category`; verify `parentId` consistency when given.
- No explicit target: for create / import / upload only, follow create-time routing per `manage/filing/entry.md`. If routing still has no target, keep the space named in session; omit optional `spaceId` (backend defaults to `personal`) only when no space was named at all.
- `space.workspace.create-space` always returns `team`; the team confirmation gate runs before calling it. Inseparable multi-resource write: one `team` target makes the whole chain follow the team flow, asking once.

Personal explicit target / existing personal node → personal branch. Team explicit target → team branch. Missing / ambiguous / contradictory → stop, resolve or disambiguate. Never default to the personal space.

## Execution

1. Locate node, kind, position, target directory; resolve a clear target for create / upload.
2. Confirm the formal Agent capability is enabled; if not, refuse, do not probe.
3. Verify the current role can write the actual target; `reader` / `invalid` or any non-writable signal refuses directly, no confirmation round.
4. Read latest content / node / sibling state; establish baseline, complete same-name check.
5. Branch: `personal` only → original request already authorizes; re-check baseline and permission right before submit, then submit via the module's native path. Contains `team` → present the final plan and stop; after explicit agreement, re-check then submit. Any confirmed item or remote baseline changed → re-present and wait.
6. After submit, read-only verification only. Unclear result → query first; never blindly retry.
7. Every successful create / import / upload / move closes the reply with exactly one line stating where the item landed — {{已存至 <space>/<directory>/<node>}} — plus the node link when the output carries one. One line, no menu, no question.

Re-checking a personal target after a remote baseline change: if the original request still realizes uniquely on the latest baseline, rebuild and continue; if the target becomes non-unique, semantics change, or scope expands, stop and ask. User-unrequested deletion, overwrite, field-type conversion, or any extra action counts as scope expansion.

Execute silently. Phrases like "write directly" / "no review" only pick the submission path; team targets still need confirmation. This rule only removes the general second-authorization gate for personal mutations — target disambiguation, unrequested extra scope, product-form selection, and publish-state sync still follow the module rules.

NOT covered — both personal and team must confirm first: a doc full-replace carrying `nodeBlockId`. Always warn and get an explicit go-ahead even when the same message requested them (in any space): database field deletion, field-type conversion (retype), batch record deletion — irreversible or data-wiping (`database/entry.md` §13). Exempt: deleting a record the running verification itself created (page/edit-flow.md §5.3, page/clone-flow.md B11) — self-created test-data cleanup.

## Team-space confirmation

Use `AskUserQuestion` (interactive card; fall back to a one- or two-sentence natural question when the tool is absent): one or two sentences stating what will be done, where, and the user-visible change; fixed options "Confirm execute" / "Cancel", no pre-selection. For complex content, show a brief list or diff in a normal reply first. Before confirmation: no business write calls, no upload-credential requests, no file PUT, no import.

Cover per operation: create/upload (file or artifact, final name, target directory); modify/content delete (target and result; text diff, Database before→after, structured summary for Page/binary); move (source, original position, target); rename (old and new names); irreversible or data-wiping ops (state the risk explicitly). One complete impact presentation may share one confirmation across an inseparable chain.

The runtime environment is for internal routing and auth only. In user-visible reasoning and replies, never reference this file, the flow, rules, sections, steps, or authorization status; state decisions as your own judgment ({{这是团队空间，我写入前需要跟你确认一下}}, never 「按规则需要确认」).

## Same-name and overwrite

- No conflict → never mention same-name handling to the user.
- Team conflict → merge the fact into final confirmation; ask only whether to still execute the original request; no handling options, no alternative names.
- Personal create/upload/move/rename with user-given final name and unique target → execute with that name even if a same-name node exists; no silent rename or overwrite.
- Multiple same-name candidates → ask the user to disambiguate (target selection, not second authorization).
- User actively requests auto-rename or overwrite → auto-rename generates the final name first; overwrite proceeds only when the native API supports atomic overwrite of a specific node (never delete-then-create); team targets include the final name / overwrite impact in confirmation.

These APIs have no universal atomic same-name handling: re-check siblings before and after submit, but never promise to eliminate concurrent conflicts.

## Currently unsupported

- No formal Agent API for file / folder node deletion. Doc block, Database field / record, or Page DOM deletion follows the modify path.
- No history-version list or restore API. With a known Page version, `list_page_artifacts.py --version` is read-only artifact fetch only.
